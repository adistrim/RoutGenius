# RouteGenius

RouteGenius is a project that implements the famous Dijkstra algorithm in a user-friendly and interactive way. It allows users to visualize how the Dijkstra algorithm works for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

The project is implemented using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The visualization is presented in a web page that is easy to use and understand, and the user can interact with the graph by adding or removing nodes and edges.
