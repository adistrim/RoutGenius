# RouteGenius

#### RouteGenius is a project that implements the famous Dijkstra algorithm in a user-friendly and interactive way. It allows users to visualize how the Dijkstra algorithm works for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

Using ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, RouteGenius presents the graph and the shortest path in an easy-to-use web page. 

Overall, RouteGenius is a great tool for anyone who wants to learn more about the Dijkstra algorithm and how it works. By providing an interactive and user-friendly way to visualize the algorithm, it makes learning about it both fun and educational.

# Usage

To use RouteGenius more effectively, follow these steps:

1. Draw multiple walls on the graph: To make the graph more complex, you can draw walls or barriers on the graph.

2. Run Dijkstra's Algorithm: After adding walls, click on the "Run Dijkstra's Algorithm" button to find the shortest path between two nodes. The algorithm will automatically navigate around the walls to find the shortest path.

3. View the Shortest Path: When the algorithm finds the shortest path between the two nodes, it draws a yellow line on the graph to indicate the path. You can then click on the "Reset" button to clear the graph and start over.

By following these steps, you can use RouteGenius more effectively to visualize and understand how the Dijkstra algorithm works for finding the shortest path in a graph.
